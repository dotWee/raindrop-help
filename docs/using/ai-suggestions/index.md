## Introduction

Say goodbye to the hassle of searching for the right collection or tag when you save a new bookmark — our new ✦ AI model automatically suggests the perfect ones for you!

You can easily correct organizational mistakes, simplify your tags, and tidy up unsorted bookmarks with just a few clicks on a [dedicated page](#tips).

We make sure to suggest **only your** collections and tags, keeping everything tailored to your personal style. Whenever you create a new collection or tag, AI takes note and includes it in future suggestions.
Although some **manual sorting is necessary** to fine-tune the AI and fix any errors.

You get **your own private AI categorization model** based on your data.   
Your data never used for training.

## Getting started {#start}
Begin by having some organized bookmarks, which can be [imported from other services or browsers](../../getting-started/import.md). This initial organization helps train the AI effectively. If starting fresh, create a few collections and tags and start organizing.

Raindrop.io improves its categorization over time by learning from your interactions, so continuously refine your collections and introduce new tags to enhance your personal AI model.

## FAQ
### Why don't I see any suggestions?
The AI model might not have enough data to make predictions yet.
Please start by creating a few collections and tags, and apply them to your bookmarks.
We ensure that suggestions are based only on the collections and tags you've already set up—we don't generate new ones like some other services might, as those tend to be too generic and not as useful.

### What if the suggestions are incorrect?
If the suggestions don't seem quite right, just select the correct ones when organizing your bookmarks. This feedback helps the AI model learn and improve over time. If you need further assistance, feel free to reach out to our support team.

### How to turn off suggestions?
1. Go to [app settings](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/app)
2. Turn off `Suggested collections and tags`
