#### Here is what you’ll be able to do:
- 🔍 [Search through the entire content](../using/search/index.md#full-text-search) of every bookmark, PDF and EPUB you’ve saved, making it extremely easy to find what you’re looking for. It's like having your personal Google.
- 💾 Create forever copies of your saved items with [Permanent Library](../using/backups/index.md#permanent-library) so you can always return to them.
- 💬 [Annotate](../using/highlights/index.md#edit) your highlights
- 🛁 Keep your bookmarks clean: find [broken](../using/search/index.md#broken-links) and [duplicate](../using/search/index.md#duplicates) links.
- 🗃️ [Upload 10 Gb files](../using/files/index.md) each month.
- 🦺 [Automatic backups](../using/backups/index.md#automatic) of your data. Never worry about accidentally deleting any of your collections, bookmarks, tags, or highlights.
